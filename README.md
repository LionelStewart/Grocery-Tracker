# Grocery-Tracker

	The project is a grocery tracker and it solves the problem of organizing information about the number of grocery items that were bought. One thing that I did particularly well was finding a simple, efficient way to parse the information and present the frequency of each unique grocery item. One thing that could enchance my code is creating a graphic user interface to interact with the stored data. This would improve my code's simplicity and effectivess by allowing the user to add, delete, and update information which would help them to interpret the data more effectively. 
  
	The part of the code that was the most challenging for me to write was organizing and storing the information in the appropriate format. I overcame this by learning how to use a Python dictionary to track the frequency of unique items and by learning how to use a text file to store information to more easily access later. These techniques are added to my support network through my experience which will make it easier to solve similar porblems if I encounter them in the future. The skills that will be the most transferable to other projects will be learning which tools allows me to solve a problem as simply, efficiently, and effectively as possible. This helps me to make the program maintainable, readable, adaptable by avoiding complicated and inflexible code which make it hard to change and adapt the code in the future.
